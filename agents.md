# Claude Code Rules

## UI Component Guidelines

- Always use Base UI for new components instead of Radix UI unless there's a specific reason not to (e.g., existing component already uses Radix, or Base UI doesn't support a required feature)
- When building new UI primitives, prefer Base UI's unstyled components
- Document the reason if Radix UI must be used for a specific component
